    "Some considerations with regard to how these notebooks will be graded:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cells in which \"# YOUR CODE HERE\" is found are the cells where your graded code should be written.\n",
    "2. In order to test out or debug your code you may also create notebook cells or edit existing notebook cells other than \"# YOUR CODE HERE\". We actually highly recommend you do so to gain a better understanding of what is happening. However, during grading, **these changes are ignored**. \n",
    "3. You must ensure that all your code for the particular task is available in the cells that say \"# YOUR CODE HERE\"\n",
    "4. Every cell that says \"# YOUR CODE HERE\" is followed by a \"raise NotImplementedError\". You need to remove that line. During grading, if an error occurs then you will lose points for your work in that section.\n",
    "5. If your code passes the \"assert\" statements, then no output will result. If your code fails the \"assert\" statements, you will get an \"AssertionError\". Getting an assertion error means you will not receive points for that particular task.\n",
    "6. If you edit the \"assert\" statements to make your code pass, they will still fail when they are graded since the autograder will ignore the modified \"assert\" statement. Make sure you don't edit the assert statements.\n",
    "7. We may sometimes have \"hidden\" tests for grading. This means that passing the visible \"assert\" statements is not sufficient. The \"assert\" statements are there as a guide but you need to make sure you understand what you're required to do and ensure that you are doing it correctly. Passing the visible tests is necessary but not sufficient to get the grade for that cell.\n",
    "8. When you are asked to define a function, make sure you **don't** use any variables outside of the parameters passed to the function. You can think of the parameters being passed to the function as a hint. Make sure you're using all of those variables.\n",
    "9. The **Grading** section at the end of the document (before the **Feedback** section) contains some code for our autograder on GradeScope. You are expected to fail this block of code in your Jupyter environment. DO NOT edit this block of code, or you may not get points for your assignment.\n",
    "10. Finally, **make sure you run \"Kernel > Restart and Run All\"** and pass all the asserts before submitting. If you don't restart the kernel, there may be some code that you ran and deleted that is still being used and that was why your asserts were passing."

    "\n",
    "Most engineers in computer scientists are familiar with convolutions. If you're not, or you need a refresher, try [this article on discrete convolutions](https://electricalacademia.com/signals-and-systems/example-of-discrete-time-graphical-convolution/). The article is on discrete *time* convolutions, but the process is the same for discrete *spatial* convolutions--which is what we are doing when we perform a 2D convolution on an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check your basic understanding of convolutions, implement the function below, which computes what the output image shape will be for a given convolutional kernel (filter) applied to a given input image. Recall that for a given dimension, the length of the output of a convolution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`L_out = L_in - L_kernel + 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "where L_in is the length of the input (pixels), L_kernel is the length of the filter/kernel, and L_out is the length of the output (pixels)\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above assumes that we haven't added any \"padding\" to the input image, e.g., pixels of value 0 that we use to extend/enlarge the input image. In Keras, you'll see that a user can specify padding as a scalar number of pixels to add __to each side of the image__. Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "`L_in_padded = L_in + 2*padding`  \n",
    "`L_out = L_in_padded - L_kernel + 1`  \n",
    "`L_out = L_in + 2*padding - L_kernel + 1`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we may want to use a convolution in which the kernel doesn't \"slide\" along the input in single-pixel steps, but in multiple-pixel steps, of step size `stride`. You may want to diagram it out for yourself on a piece of paper (in a manner like that of the article linked above), but we effectively just need to divide the output length by the stride value (before adding the 1) to get strided output size. Because it may be fractional, the final answer is actually the floor of that previous result. This gives us...\n",
    "\n",
    "`L_out = floor( (L_in + 2*padding - L_kernel) / stride + 1 )`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function below, you'll need to implement that equation separately for the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image and kernel. Do not assume that either the image or the kernel are square. In Python, `int()` converts a number to an integer, executing a floor operation if the number is floating-point."
